## About Fennec M2X

Fennec M2X (`org.eclipse.fennec.m2x`) provides clean-room, specification-compliant
implementations of the OMG modeling-transformation stack — **OCL**, **QVT
Operational**, **QVT Relations** and **MOFM2T** — that run as plain Java 21
libraries and as OSGi services. Every engine works without the Eclipse platform.

### Compile once, execute often

QVT-O, QVT-R and MOFM2T units can be compiled into a storable document — the AST
together with its manifest, its dependencies and the fingerprints it was built
against — and later loaded, prepared and executed without a parser. How that
works, and what the dependency modes `embed`, `pin` and `rebind` mean, is
described once for all languages in the
[Compiled Units guide](/guides/compiled-units).

### Use it in the Eclipse IDE

The OCL engine ships as an Eclipse feature that adds OCL delegate support to the
generic EMF editor. Install it from the
[Eclipse update site](https://download.eclipse.org/fennec/m2x/ocl/p2/snapshot/),
or follow the [installation guide](/guides/ide-installation).
