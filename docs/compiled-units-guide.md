# Compiled Units — User Guide

A **compiled unit** is a transformation or template that has been parsed, resolved and packaged
into one document: it can be stored, loaded somewhere else and executed there, with nothing left to
resolve. This guide is the one place the mechanism is described; it works the same way for QVT-O,
QVT-R and MOFM2T, and every example below is a shape the test suites execute.

## 1. Why

`parse()` gives you an object graph that runs. It does **not** give you something you can store:
a parser creates objects the tree points at but that no metamodel feature contains — the variable
`self`, a type instance for every `Integer`, the default expression of an intermediate class. In
memory that costs nothing. `resource.save()` fails on exactly those objects with a
`DanglingHREFException`, and `EcoreUtil.copy` produces a copy whose references still point at the
original's objects.

A compiled unit gives them a home beside the script, records what the unit was built against, and
carries its dependencies — as much of them as you ask for. It is what makes these work:

- keep a parsed transformation in a repository and run it on another machine, another day;
- run a pipeline where one transformation's output is the next one's input, without the two
  disagreeing about what a `Book` is;
- know whether the thing you are about to run is still the thing you tested.

---

## 2. The three phases

| Phase | What happens | Resolvers asked |
|---|---|---|
| **Compile** | parse → resolve the imports → package | yes |
| **Prepare** | load the unit and its closure, verify the metamodels, bind | yes |
| **Execute** | run it | **never** |

The rule in the third column is the point of the whole mechanism, and it is asserted by a test
rather than by convention: the engine that executes a prepared unit is configured with a resolver
that throws if it is ever asked.

All three phases are shown running over real files in the example projects — each one carries an
`AdHocExample` (no units at all) and a `CompiledUnitExample` side by side, so the difference is
readable as a diff:

| Project | Unit lifecycle it shows |
|---|---|
| `org.eclipse.fennec.m2x.qvto.example` | compile → store → prepare → execute, with a second `.qvto` as a pinned dependency |
| `org.eclipse.fennec.m2x.qvtd.example` | the same for a `.qvtr` transformation |
| `org.eclipse.fennec.m2x.m2t.example` | the same for `.mtl` modules, with an imported module |
| `org.eclipse.fennec.m2x.ocl.example` | compile → store → prepare → **register** — for OCL the lifecycle ends there (see section 11) |

---

## 3. `compile()` beside `parse()`

Every engine has both. `parse()` returns the language's root object, `compile()` returns a
`CompiledUnit` document whose `getUnit()` is that very object.

**QVT-O**

```java
QvtoEngine engine = QvtoEngines.create(QvtoConfiguration.builder(oclConfig).build());

OperationalTransformation ast = engine.parse(source, "Main");   // in-memory, not storable
CompiledUnit compiled = engine.compile(source, "Main");         // storable document

// the script inside is the same object parse() would have returned
OperationalTransformation script = (OperationalTransformation) compiled.getUnit();
engine.execute(script, QvtoExecutionContext.of(extent));
```

**QVT-R**

```java
QvtdEngine engine = QvtdEngines.create(QvtdConfiguration.builder(oclConfig).build());
CompiledUnit compiled = engine.compile(source, "T");
RelationalTransformation script = (RelationalTransformation) compiled.getUnit();
```

**MOFM2T**

```java
M2tEngine engine = M2tEngines.create(M2tConfiguration.builder(oclConfig).build());
CompiledUnit compiled = engine.compile(templateSource, "my.module");
Module module = (Module) compiled.getUnit();
```

What the document holds:

```java
compiled.getId();            // a UUID, unique across all compiled units
compiled.getNamespace();     // grouping for versioning, yours to set
compiled.getVersion();       // what someone claims this is
compiled.getUnit();          // the script — an EPackage in all three languages
compiled.getSatellite();     // the parser's leftovers, so the document is self-contained
compiled.getEmbedded();      // dependencies carried inside, under `embed`
compiled.getPackages();      // copies of dynamic metamodels (see §6)
compiled.getManifest();      // what it was built from and against
```

The manifest is the interesting half:

```java
CompiledUnitManifest m = compiled.getManifest();
m.getLanguage();             // "qvto", "qvtr", "m2t", "ocl"
m.getQualifiedName();        // the name it is imported by
m.getUnitFingerprint();      // m2x1:… — what this unit is
m.getSourceFingerprint();    // m2x1:… — the text it was compiled from
m.getDependencyMode();       // how imports were bound
m.getNature();               // TRANSFORMATION — startable — or LIBRARY, without loading the AST
m.getDependencyEntry();      // the units it needs
m.getPackageEntry();         // the metamodels it was compiled against, with fp1 fingerprints
m.getBlackboxRequirement();  // the blackbox implementations the runtime has to bring
```

A `compile()` that cannot make the document self-contained fails with the language's parse
exception, naming the unit — not with a dangling reference on someone else's `save()` later.

---

## 4. Dependency modes: embed, pin, rebind

An import is a dependency. What `compile()` does with it is the mode, and the mode is recorded in
the manifest so that prepare can read how the unit was built:

| Mode | The dependency | Reproducible | Fixes arrive | Needs a resolver to run |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `embed` | compiled in turn and carried inside the unit | absolutely | never | no |
| `pin` (default) | named in the manifest with its unit fingerprint | while that version is findable | on recompile | yes |
| `rebind` | named in the manifest | no | automatically | yes |

```java
CompiledUnit archived  = engine.compile(source, "Main", UnitCompileOptions.of(DependencyMode.EMBED));
CompiledUnit pinned    = engine.compile(source, "Main");                                  // pin
CompiledUnit following = engine.compile(source, "Main", UnitCompileOptions.of(DependencyMode.REBIND));
```

An import nobody can resolve fails the compile in **every** mode — `Cannot resolve import: X`. A
cycle is reported under `embed` and `pin`, where the compiler follows the dependency; under
`rebind` the closure is prepare's business.

### What each language binds

**QVT-O** — `import`/`access` of a module. Under `embed` the dependency becomes an entry of
`getEmbedded()` and the import points into it; under `pin`/`rebind` the parser's stub stays and is
bound later.

```java
QvtoUnitResolver lib = name -> "HelperLib".equals(name)
        ? Optional.of(new QvtoUnit.SourceUnit(name, URI.createURI("mem:/HelperLib.qvto"), LIB_SOURCE))
        : Optional.empty();
QvtoEngine engine = QvtoEngines.create(QvtoConfiguration.builder(oclConfig)
        .addUnitResolver(lib).unitResolverEnabled(true).build());

CompiledUnit unit = engine.compile("""
        modeltype ECORE uses ecore('http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore');
        import HelperLib;
        transformation Main(inout m : ECORE) { main() { log(greet()); } }
        """, "Main", UnitCompileOptions.of(DependencyMode.EMBED));

unit.getEmbedded().get(0).getManifest().getQualifiedName();   // "HelperLib"
// runs on an engine that knows no resolver at all — also after a store round trip
bare.execute((OperationalTransformation) unit.getUnit(), QvtoExecutionContext.of(extent));
```

**QVT-R** — `import` of a transformation. QVT-R binds an import by *merging* the imported relations
into the importing transformation (§7.11.1.1), so under `embed` the merge happens at compile time
and the import is struck; there is no embedded child, because nothing would point at it. The
manifest entry names what was merged.

```java
CompiledUnit unit = engine.compile("""
        import shared.Library;
        transformation importer(source : bookshelf, target : bookshelf) { }
        """, "importer", UnitCompileOptions.of(DependencyMode.EMBED));

((RelationalTransformation) unit.getUnit()).getRule();        // the merged relations
unit.getManifest().getDependencyEntry().get(0);               // shared.Library, embed, fingerprint
```

**MOFM2T** — `extends` and `import` of a module. Under `embed` the dependency is carried and the
module is linked against it; under `pin`/`rebind` the module stays unbound and keeps what it still
has to bind on itself, so an engine that never parsed it can link it after a reload.

```java
CompiledUnit unit = engine.compile("""
        [module main(_'http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore') extends base/]
        [template public main(c : EClass)][file ('out.txt', false)][greet(c)/][/file][/template]
        """, "main", UnitCompileOptions.of(DependencyMode.EMBED));

((Module) unit.getUnit()).getExtends();                        // bound, inside the document
```

### Blackboxes are requirements, not dependencies

A blackbox implementation is never carried — its declaration is. The manifest records the name and
a fingerprint over the signatures the unit was compiled against, so a runtime that brings the right
name with the wrong shape is caught when the unit is prepared, not at the call.

```java
compiled.getManifest().getBlackboxRequirement().get(0).getName();                  // "mylib"
compiled.getManifest().getBlackboxRequirement().get(0).getSignatureFingerprint();  // m2x1:…
```

MOFM2T has no blackboxes: its Java services arrive through the OCL operation providers of the
engine, so a compiled module never carries a requirement.

---

## 5. The unit store

`UnitStore` holds sources and compiled units, keyed by language, qualified name, kind and
fingerprint — and that is all it does: key ↔ document (#211). `DefaultUnitStore` implements it
over a `UnitStoreBackend` — bytes by key, keys by name. The in-memory backend needs nothing:

```java
UnitStore store = new DefaultUnitStore(new InMemoryUnitStoreBackend());

// a compiled unit goes in as its document; language and name are the manifest's
UnitKey key = store.put(engine.compile(source, "Main"));

// … and comes back as an independent copy — references unresolved, see below
PackagedUnit loaded = (PackagedUnit) store.get(key).orElseThrow();
UnitMaterializer.defaults().materialize(loaded, new UnitResourceSet());
engine.execute((OperationalTransformation) loaded.document().getUnit(), context);
```

A source is stored under its language tag and its source fingerprint:

```java
store.put("qvto", new QvtoUnit.SourceUnit("HelperLib", URI.createURI("file:/lib.qvto"), text));
```

Both kinds live side by side under one name and are told apart by kind:

```java
store.versions("qvto", "HelperLib", UnitKind.SOURCE);     // every stored version, newest first
store.versions("qvto", "HelperLib", UnitKind.COMPILED);
store.get(UnitKey.of("qvto", "HelperLib", UnitKind.COMPILED));                    // the newest
store.get(UnitKey.pinned("qvto", "HelperLib", UnitKind.COMPILED, "m2x1:9f86…"));  // exactly that one
```

Three properties worth knowing:

- **Only documents.** A bare AST has no manifest to be stored by — `compile()` first. A document
  without one is a `UnitStoreException` saying so.
- **Copies both ways.** What you store is copied on the way in, what you load is a fresh copy: a
  later write cannot change what an earlier caller holds.
- **Unresolved on the way out.** A document leaves the store with its references unresolved —
  proxies are the transport state. `UnitMaterializer` binds it in a consumer's context
  (`UnitResourceSet`), serves the copies it carries, and runs the validation funnel; prepare does
  all of that for you. Which metamodel instance a reference binds to is a property of that
  context, never of the store.
- **A missing version is not "not found".** A pinned key the store does not have is an error that
  names the versions it does have. `Optional.empty()` means the name is unknown, nothing else.


### The object medium: units from an `EObjectRegistry`

`RegistryUnitStore` (bundle `org.eclipse.fennec.m2x.unit.registry`) is the same contract over a
different medium: an emf.osgi `EObjectRegistry` holding live compiled-unit documents — the rail a
model atlas delivers on, and the pre-unit pattern (a parsed AST handed around as a loaded EMF
object) with the envelope that made it sound.

```java
EObjectRegistryWriter writer = EObjectRegistries.createRegistry("units");
UnitStore store = new RegistryUnitStore(writer);                    // read-write
UnitStore readOnly = new RegistryUnitStore(writer.getRegistry());   // get/contains/versions only
```

The contract does not change with the medium. What goes in is normalized into the transport
state — one XMI round trip on the way in, so a document whose references were bound in the
producer's context arrives with them unresolved, exactly as the byte medium delivers. What comes
out is an independent copy; the registry's live instance never leaves. Entries carry the key as
properties (`unit.language`, `unit.kind`, `unit.qualifiedName`, `unit.fingerprint` — deliberately
no `emf.fingerprint`: that property is a plain model fingerprint, the metadata-bridge join key,
and a unit references several packages). Entries another source filed — unit XMIs on disk behind
a `FileEObjectProvider`, an atlas — answer by what their manifest says, whatever their entry key
looks like; removing is limited to what the store's own source wrote.

Under OSGi, one component publishes the store over a named registry:

```json
"M2xRegistryUnitStore": {
    "registry.target": "(emf.eobject.registry.name=units)",
    "writer.target": "(emf.eobject.registry.name=units)"
}
```

Without the writer reference the published store is read-only — the registry is the delivery,
writing is the content source's business.

### Resolving from a store

Each language has a resolver that reads from a store — compiled unit first, source second:

```java
QvtoEngine engine = QvtoEngines.create(QvtoConfiguration.builder(oclConfig)
        .addUnitResolver(new QvtoStoreUnitResolver(store))
        .unitResolverEnabled(true).build());
```

`QvtdStoreUnitResolver` and `M2tStoreUnitResolver` are the same for their languages.

### Units by reference

A resolver does not have to hand the unit over — it may answer with where it lives:

```java
QvtoUnitResolver byLocation = name -> "shelf.Titles".equals(name)
        ? Optional.of(new QvtoUnit.ResourceUnit(name, URI.createFileURI("titles.xmi")))
        : Optional.empty();
```

Loading happens at consumption, in the consumer's context, through the same materializer as a
store load (#214): a URI holding a compiled-unit document gets the full treatment — safe parse,
carried copies served, everything resolved, validation funnel — and a pin records the fingerprint
its manifest carries. A URI holding a bare AST — the pre-unit shape — loads too: it binds in the
consumer's context and no proxy is handed on, but there is no manifest to check and no copy to
serve. A URI holding neither is a link-time error naming the import.

The same holds for what a store resolver answers: since #214 the resolvers read and decide
nothing — a document-backed unit is bound by the consumer's linker at the moment it takes the
unit in. Which metamodel instance a reference binds to is always the consumer's business.
`QvtdUnit.ResourceUnit` and `M2tUnit.ResourceUnit` are the same for their languages.



---

## 6. Prepare and execute

Prepare turns stored units into something an engine can run without asking anybody anything. It
loads the unit **and its dependency closure** into one resource set, verifies the metamodels, and
lets the language bind what is left:

```java
UnitPreparer preparer = UnitPreparer.withDefaults(store, engine.unitBinder());
PreparedContext prepared = preparer.prepare(mainKey);

QvtoExecutionResult result = engine.execute(prepared, "Main", QvtoExecutionContext.of(extent));
```

`M2tEngine.execute(prepared, "my.module", M2tContext.of(input))` and
`QvtdEngine.execute(prepared, "T", context)` are the same for their languages. A context is built
once and reused across many executions.

**What prepare needs in the store.** Prepare loads documents by key — it does not parse. So every
dependency the manifest names under `pin` or `rebind` has to be in the store as a **compiled**
unit; a *source* under that name serves the compiler (through a store resolver, which parses it),
not prepare. Storing the library compiled is the step that is easy to forget:

```java
store.put(engine.compile(libSource, "HelperLib"));                          // prepare finds this
store.put("qvto", new QvtoUnit.SourceUnit("HelperLib", uri, libSource));    // the compiler finds this
```

Without it, prepare says so rather than guessing:

```
the store has no compiled unit 'HelperLib'
```

Under `embed` the question does not arise — the dependency travels inside the unit.

### Metamodels: the runtime instance wins, on equality

Every `PackageEntry` of every unit is checked against the context's registry — the same tiers
its references resolved through, so verification and resolution cannot disagree:

| Runtime has | Fingerprints | What the unit's types resolve to |
|---|---|---|
| an instance | equal | **the runtime instance** — generated code stays in play, blackboxes get generated types |
| nothing | — | the copy the unit carries (`getPackages()`) |
| an instance | **different** | hard failure at prepare, naming the nsURI and both values |

```
'Duplicate' was compiled against http://example.org/shelf/1.0 with fingerprint fp1:2b1c…,
the runtime provides fp1:9a04…
```

Two units of one run that pin different versions of one name are a conflict too — not a silent
choice.

### OCL: prepare, then register

A Complete OCL document is the fourth unit language (#209), with one twist: its lifecycle ends
at prepare. `OclEngine.compileDocument(name, text)` seals the document's constraints under the
tag `ocl` with `nature = LIBRARY`; the runtime side prepares it like any unit and then
*registers* instead of executing:

```java
PreparedContext prepared = new UnitPreparer(store, List.of(oclEngine.unitBinder()))
        .registerPackage(company).prepare(key);
oclEngine.registerCompleteOclDocument(prepared, "company.rules");
```

The document's `def:` constraints take effect exactly as with the text-taking contribution API
— only that no parser ran. A document has no unit imports, so there is no store resolver for
OCL and its binder only holds the root to its type.

### A pipeline shares one context

That is what the context is for: T1's output is T2's input, and both agree about the metamodel.

```java
PreparedContext prepared = preparer.prepare(renameKey, duplicateKey);

BasicQvtoModelExtent extent = new BasicQvtoModelExtent(books);
engine.execute(prepared, "Rename",    QvtoExecutionContext.of(extent));
engine.execute(prepared, "Duplicate", QvtoExecutionContext.of(extent));
```

A model loaded **in** the context carries the context's types, which is what an extent of
already-loaded objects cannot promise:

```java
List<EObject> roots = prepared.contents(URI.createFileURI("/models/shelf.xmi"));
engine.execute(prepared, "Rename", QvtoExecutionContext.of(new BasicQvtoModelExtent(roots)));
```

### Under rebind: what was actually bound

Under `rebind` the unit fingerprint says nothing about the dependencies, so prepare records what it
took, in the loaded copy's manifest:

```java
CompiledUnit ran = ((PackagedUnit) prepared.unit("Main").orElseThrow()).document();
ran.getManifest().getResolvedClosure().get(0).getQualifiedName();  // "HelperLib"
ran.getManifest().getResolvedClosure().get(0).getFingerprint();    // the version that ran
```

---

## 7. Two worked examples

Both examples use one dynamic metamodel — `shelf`, with a `Book` that has a `title` — and the
QVT-O engine; QVT-R and MOFM2T work the same way with their own roots. Everything below is
executed by `CompiledUnitsGuideExamplesTest`.

### 7.1 One script becomes a stored unit

The metamodel first. It is *dynamic*: built in memory here, loaded from an `.ecore` in practice —
either way there is no generated code behind it, and that decides what the unit carries (§7.3).

```java
EPackage shelf = EcoreFactory.eINSTANCE.createEPackage();
shelf.setName("shelf");
shelf.setNsURI("http://example.org/m2x/guide/shelf/1.0");
shelf.setNsPrefix("shelf");
// … plus an EClass Book with an EAttribute title : EString
```

No registry to assemble: a dynamic metamodel is *contributed* — local to the configuration,
nothing leaks into the global registry; `packageRegistry(…)` and a resource set stay the
injection points for a managed registry (#212). Compile instead of parse — one call, and the
result is a document rather than an object graph:

```java
QvtoEngine engine = QvtoEngines.create(QvtoConfiguration.builder(oclConfig)
        .registerPackage(shelf).build());

CompiledUnit unit = engine.compile("""
        modeltype SHELF uses 'http://example.org/m2x/guide/shelf/1.0';
        transformation Uppercase(inout m : SHELF) {
            main() {
                m.objectsOfType(Book)->forEach(b) {
                    b.title := b.title.toUpperCase();
                };
            }
        }
        """, "Uppercase");
```

What came out — the manifest says what this is and what it was built against:

```java
unit.getManifest().getQualifiedName();        // "Uppercase"
unit.getManifest().getUnitFingerprint();      // m2x1:… — this exact unit
unit.getManifest().getDependencyEntry();      // empty: nothing imported

PackageEntry entry = unit.getManifest().getPackageEntry().get(0);
entry.getNsURI();                             // http://example.org/m2x/guide/shelf/1.0
entry.getFingerprint();                       // fp1:… — the version it was compiled against
entry.getRole();                              // EMBEDDED — no generated code, so a copy travels
unit.getPackages().size();                    // 1 — and here it is
```

Store it. The key carries the fingerprint, and that is the version anything else pins:

```java
UnitStore store = new DefaultUnitStore(new InMemoryUnitStoreBackend());
UnitKey key = store.put(unit);

key.fingerprint().orElseThrow();              // == unit.getManifest().getUnitFingerprint()
```

Run it from the store — on an engine whose only resolver *fails* if it is ever asked, which is how
the test proves that nothing was left to resolve:

```java
QvtoUnitResolver forbidden = name -> {
    throw new AssertionError("a resolver was asked for '" + name + "' after prepare");
};
QvtoEngine runner = QvtoEngines.create(QvtoConfiguration.builder(oclConfig)
        .addUnitResolver(forbidden).unitResolverEnabled(true).build());

UnitPreparer preparer = new UnitPreparer(store, List.of(runner.unitBinder()))
        .registerPackage(shelf);
PreparedContext prepared = preparer.prepare(key);

EObject book = /* a Book of the shelf metamodel, title "moby dick" */;
runner.execute(prepared, "Uppercase", QvtoExecutionContext.of(new BasicQvtoModelExtent(book)));
// title: "MOBY DICK"
```

`UnitPreparer.withDefaults(store, runner.unitBinder())` is the short form where every metamodel
is generated code — which registers itself globally, and the preparer's contexts fall back to the
global registry on their own. `registerPackage(…)` contributes what is not: the caller's dynamic
metamodels, one call each, no registry assembled. The runner engine needs no resolution context of
its own for stored execution: the context is given exactly once, to the preparer, the
`PreparedContext` carries it, and `execute(prepared, …)` uses only that. For a managed context —
an OSGi-provided resource set, a pipeline's own — pass it explicitly:
`preparer.prepare(List.of(key), theResourceSet)` (#212).

### 7.2 Three scripts, and what travels with them

One transformation over two libraries:

```java
static final String CASE_LIB = """
        library text.Case {
            helper shout(s : String) : String {
                return s.toUpperCase() + '!';
            }
        }
        """;
static final String TITLES_LIB = """
        library shelf.Titles {
            helper prefix(s : String) : String {
                return 'now reading: ' + s;
            }
        }
        """;
static final String ANNOUNCE = """
        modeltype SHELF uses 'http://example.org/m2x/guide/shelf/1.0';
        import shelf.Titles;
        import text.Case;
        transformation Announce(inout m : SHELF) {
            main() {
                m.objectsOfType(Book)->forEach(b) {
                    b.title := shout(prefix(b.title));
                };
            }
        }
        """;
```

The compiling engine may ask for the two libraries — as sources here, from a store or a bundle just
as well (§5, §8):

```java
Map<String, String> sources = Map.of("text.Case", CASE_LIB, "shelf.Titles", TITLES_LIB);
QvtoUnitResolver libraries = name -> Optional.ofNullable(sources.get(name))
        .map(source -> new QvtoUnit.SourceUnit(name, URI.createURI("mem:/" + name + ".qvto"), source));

QvtoEngine compiler = QvtoEngines.create(QvtoConfiguration.builder(oclConfig)
        .registerPackage(shelf).addUnitResolver(libraries).unitResolverEnabled(true).build());
```

#### Everything inside — `embed`

```java
CompiledUnit archive = compiler.compile(ANNOUNCE, "Announce",
        UnitCompileOptions.of(DependencyMode.EMBED));

archive.getEmbedded();     // two complete compiled units: shelf.Titles and text.Case
archive.getPackages();     // one EPackage: the copy of the shelf metamodel
```

One document, and it is the whole delivery. On the other side nothing is registered, nothing is
resolvable, and no source of either library exists anywhere:

```java
UnitStore transported = new DefaultUnitStore(new InMemoryUnitStoreBackend());
UnitKey key = transported.put(archive);

// zero registry lines: the preparer builds its context internally, the document carries the rest
QvtoEngine runner = QvtoEngines.create(QvtoConfiguration.builder(oclConfig)
        .addUnitResolver(forbidden).unitResolverEnabled(true).build());
PreparedContext prepared = new UnitPreparer(transported, List.of(runner.unitBinder())).prepare(key);

prepared.units();          // one unit: "Announce" — the libraries are inside it, not beside it
```

The metamodel this run has is the copy the unit brought, and that is what the prepared unit's types
resolve to. So that is the instance the input model has to be built with:

```java
EPackage carried = ((PackagedUnit) prepared.unit("Announce").orElseThrow())
        .document().getPackages().get(0);
EObject book = carried.getEFactoryInstance()
        .create((EClass) carried.getEClassifier("Book"));   // "moby dick"

runner.execute(prepared, "Announce", QvtoExecutionContext.of(new BasicQvtoModelExtent(book)));
// title: "NOW READING: MOBY DICK!"
```

**One boundary worth knowing.** A carried copy serves the *unit's* references; it does not enter the
package registry. A model in a file whose metamodel exists only as a copy therefore cannot be loaded
through the context:

```java
prepared.contents(URI.createFileURI("/models/shelf.xmi"));
// UnitPrepareException: cannot load … Package with uri 'http://example.org/…/shelf/1.0' not found
```

Register the metamodel on the executing side if you need that — an equal one is adopted and costs
nothing (§6).

#### Only links — `pin`

The same three scripts, compiled with the default mode:

```java
CompiledUnit main = compiler.compile(ANNOUNCE, "Announce");   // pin

main.getEmbedded();                              // empty — nothing carried
main.getManifest().getDependencyEntry();         // shelf.Titles and text.Case,
                                                 //   each with mode PIN and an m2x1 fingerprint
```

The two libraries and the transformation are told apart by the manifest, not by inspecting
the AST: `text.Case` and `shelf.Titles` carry `nature = LIBRARY`, `Announce` carries
`TRANSFORMATION` — a standalone library source parses into a synthetic transformation wrapper,
and the compiler records the unwrapped truth at package time (#224). A store, a registry entry
(`unit.nature`) or an authoring UI answers "startable or dependency?" without opening a
document.

Each unit now lives in the store once, and prepare needs the ones the manifest names — as
**compiled** units, because prepare loads documents and has no parser:

```java
UnitKey key = store.put(main);
UnitPreparer preparer = new UnitPreparer(store, List.of(runner.unitBinder()))
        .registerPackage(shelf);

preparer.prepare(key);
// UnitPrepareException: the store has no compiled unit 'shelf.Titles'

store.put(compiler.compile(CASE_LIB, "text.Case"));
store.put(compiler.compile(TITLES_LIB, "shelf.Titles"));

PreparedContext prepared = preparer.prepare(key);
prepared.units();     // three: Announce, shelf.Titles, text.Case — the closure, each once
```

A library that several transformations import is stored, fingerprinted and loaded **once** per run,
however many units name it. That is the whole difference from `embed`, where each archive brings its
own copy.

#### Which to choose

| | `embed` | `pin` (default) | `rebind` |
|---|---|---|---|
| The dependency is | inside the unit | named, with its fingerprint | named |
| Prepare needs the store to hold | nothing else | the pinned versions | the newest versions |
| A fix in the library arrives | never | on recompile | on the next prepare |
| One library shared by ten units | ten copies | one | one |
| Good for | transport, archiving, an air-gapped runtime | a repository that holds what it runs | a unit that should follow its libraries |

### 7.3 Metamodels: carried or named

Units are your choice per compile. Metamodels are not — the packager decides per package, by
whether it has generated code:

| The metamodel | In the manifest | In the document | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **dynamic** — no generated code (an `.ecore` loaded at runtime) | `PackageEntry`, role `EMBEDDED`, `fp1:…` | a **copy** in `getPackages()` | a runtime may have no way to supply it |
| **generated** — an `EPackage` subclass with a factory | `PackageEntry`, role `REFERENCED`, `fp1:…` | nothing | the runtime has it, and its generated types are the better ones |
| Ecore, XMLType, the OCL standard library | nothing | nothing | part of every runtime by definition |

```java
// a unit over a generated metamodel: named, never copied
CompiledUnit unit = plain.compile(overOclMetamodel, "Count");
unit.getManifest().getPackageEntry().get(0).getRole();   // REFERENCED
unit.getPackages();                                      // empty
```

So the way to turn a copy into a link is to give the metamodel generated code — or to register it on
the compiling *and* the executing side, which is the same thing seen from prepare: an entry whose
nsURI the runtime answers for, with an equal fingerprint, resolves to the runtime instance and the
copy is not used. A differing fingerprint is a hard failure naming both values, never a silent
choice (§6).

The copy is held to its recorded fingerprint as strictly as a runtime instance is: changing a
carried metamodel after the unit was sealed is what the validator reports as `carried metamodel
changed` (§9).

## 8. Several sources for one name

With one resolver nothing here matters. With several — a store, a file system, a bundle — three
rules apply, in one place (`ResolutionPolicy`), for compile and for the execute-time link alike:

1. **Every source is asked**, not only until the first answer. The first answer in source order is
   what is used: configured resolvers in configuration order, OSGi whiteboard services by
   `service.ranking` (highest first), class-path providers in declaration order.
2. **A failing source is an error.** A resolver that throws ends the resolution naming the source
   and the cause — `Cannot resolve import 'HelperLib': source …StoreUnitResolver failed …: disk on
   fire`. It is never turned into "not found", so a broken store cannot let a stale copy from the
   next source step in unnoticed.
3. **Answers have to agree.** Two sources with different content for one name are a conflict naming
   both. Comparable pairs: source ↔ source by source fingerprint, document ↔ document by unit
   fingerprint, source ↔ document by the document's `sourceFingerprint`.

**Ownership:** a unit a resolver hands out is *lent*. The receiver must not mutate it — the
compiler copies what it embeds, the linker binds inside the importing unit only. A resolver may
therefore hand out the same instance again and again.

---

## 9. Validation on load

A unit from a store bypasses the parser and every check it enforces. The store itself is dumb and
does not judge what it reads; the funnel is the `UnitMaterializer`, which every consumer's load
goes through — prepare uses it internally, on by default:

| Check | Catches |
|---|---|
| Integrity | the unit fingerprint recomputed and compared with the manifest |
| Manifest | format version, language and name, `pin` entries with fingerprint, embedded units of the same language, package copies with an entry |
| Closure | every reference that leaves the document points into a metamodel; no proxies |
| Ecore structure | the multiplicity and data-value rules of the languages' own features |
| Size | depth ≤ 1 000, objects ≤ 1 000 000 (configurable) |

```java
UnitMaterializer checking = UnitMaterializer.defaults();          // validates
UnitMaterializer trusting = UnitMaterializer.withoutValidation(); // for a trusted, hot medium
new UnitPreparer(store, fingerprints, binders, trusting);
```

The language's half runs in prepare, before binding: the root is a unit of the language, every
variable use has its declaration in the document, QVT-R domains refer to declared typed models,
MOFM2T invocations are bound or recorded for binding.

**The fingerprint protects against drift, not against manipulation** — whoever can change a unit
can recompute its fingerprint. Authenticity is the backend's question: `UnitStoreBackend` stores
and returns bytes, so a backend that signs on `put` and verifies on `get` closes that gap without
any change to the store or the format. The shipped in-memory backend does not sign.

## 10. Fingerprints

Two kinds, two schemes, both in the manifest:

- **`fp1`** for **packages** — from emf.osgi's `FingerprintService`, the value the ecosystem keys
  models by (`@EPackage(fingerprint)`, the metadata service). This is what prepare compares.
- **`m2x1`** for **units** — SHA-256 over a canonical form of the AST. A reformatted source yields
  the same value; two transformations with the same intermediate classes and different logic do
  not. Source positions, comments and `documentation` annotations never enter; a metamodel
  reference enters as `nsURI#//Classifier/feature`, so where a metamodel was loaded from does not
  change the value, and a metamodel change does not cascade into every expression.

```java
compiled.getManifest().getUnitFingerprint();     // m2x1:9f86d081…
compiled.getManifest().getSourceFingerprint();   // m2x1:… over the LF-normalized text
compiled.getManifest().getPackageEntry().get(0).getFingerprint();   // fp1:2b1c…
```

Under `embed` and `pin` the unit fingerprint folds in the fingerprints of the dependencies, so the
same source compiled against a changed library has a different value. Under `rebind` it describes
the unit alone — which is why prepare records the closure.

The `m2x1` scheme is **frozen**: a change to the canonicalization needs a new tag, and a golden
value in the test suite says so.

---

## 11. What this means for OCL

A single OCL *expression* is not something you import by name, so there is no `OclEngine.compile()`
for one. A Complete OCL *document* is a unit, though — `compileDocument()` seals it under the tag
`ocl`, and its lifecycle ends at register rather than at execute (see
[section 6](#6-prepare-and-execute)). Beyond that, two things touch OCL wherever it appears inside
another language's unit:

- **OCL expressions are inside every unit.** The `m2x1` canonicalization walks them, so what the
  fingerprint says about a QVT-O mapping includes the OCL it contains. The standard-library types
  (`Integer`, `String`, `OclAny`) live in their own EPackage and enter as URIs, not as copies.
- **Property resolution.** Where an expression navigates to a property whose owner type is not
  known at parse time, the parser leaves a *marked* placeholder — the evaluator resolves it by name
  at runtime, which is what a template over a dynamic model needs, and the mark is what lets the
  fingerprint and the validator tell it from a resolved feature. A caller that hands the parser a
  whole document can ask for the typo instead:

```java
new OclParserSupport(registry).strictPropertyResolution(true).parse("self.nam", personClass);
// OclParseException: Unknown property (Person::nam)
```

## 12. Bundles and API index

Everything neutral is in **`org.eclipse.fennec.m2x.unit`**; the language APIs depend on it, never
the other way round. What needs a `BundleContext` lives beside it in
**`org.eclipse.fennec.m2x.unit.osgi`**, so that `unit` stays framework-neutral and every engine
runs as a plain Java library (D39).

| Package | What is in it |
|---|---|
| `…unit.api` | `Unit` (+`Source`, `Compiled`, `Packaged`, `Referenced`), `UnitKey`, `UnitKind`, `UnitStore`, `UnitCompileOptions`, `UnitBinder`, `PreparedContext`, `UnitResourceSet`, the exceptions |
| `…unit.compile` | `UnitPackager`, `ReferencedPackages`, `SignatureFingerprint` |
| `…unit.store` | `DefaultUnitStore`, `UnitStoreBackend`, `InMemoryUnitStoreBackend`, `PackagedUnit`, `StoredSource`, `UnitXmi`, `UnitDocuments` |
| `…unit.materialize` | `UnitMaterializer` — binds a stored document in a consumer's context, loads units named by reference |
| `…unit.prepare` | `UnitPreparer` |
| `…unit.resolve` | `ResolutionPolicy`, `ServiceLoaderUnitResolver` (the class-path half of discovery) |
| `…unit.validate` | `UnitValidator` |
| `…unit.satellite` | `SatelliteCollector` |
| `…unit.fingerprint` | `DefaultUnitFingerprintService`, `AstCanonicalizer` |
| `…model.compiled` | the `CompiledUnit` metamodel (nsURI `http://www.eclipse.org/fennec/m2x/compiled/1.0`) |
| `…unit.registry` (own bundle) | `RegistryUnitStore`, `RegistryUnitStoreComponent` — the object medium over the emf.osgi `EObjectRegistry`; a bridge bundle, so m2x core stays free of emf.osgi beyond the api |
| `…unit.osgi` | `OsgiServiceUnitResolver` — the whiteboard half of discovery, one for all three languages (in the separate `unit.osgi` bundle) |

Per language, in the engine bundle: `QvtoStoreUnitResolver`, `QvtdStoreUnitResolver`,
`M2tStoreUnitResolver`, the component and the class-path resolver that wrap the two shared
discovery implementations, and `engine.unitBinder()` for the preparer.

**Where the decisions are written down:** [QVT-O Architecture](qvto-architecture.md) §4.t–§4.z —
why type references stay non-containment, why satellites get a dedicated container, why packages
keep `fp1` while units get `m2x1`, and what the resolution order in a `UnitResourceSet` is.

*The engines run without a store and without OSGi, as plain Java libraries. Everything on this page
is optional: `parse()` and `execute()` are unchanged.*
